The solution to this issue involved double-checking my `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that the `content` array accurately reflected all the files containing Tailwind classes.  Incorrect configuration of the purge option could cause some classes to be removed during the build process, even if they were correctly defined. I added the correct paths to the content array in tailwind.config.js.  It was necessary to restart the development server to correctly apply the changes.
